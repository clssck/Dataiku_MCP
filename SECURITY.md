## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public issues for security vulnerabilities.

Instead:

1. Open a private security advisory in this repository:
   `Security` tab -> `Report a vulnerability`
2. Include a clear description, impact, and reproduction details.
3. Include any suggested mitigations if available.

We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and coordinate next steps.
